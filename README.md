Spiral Matrix function for Ulam Spirals

The main function ulam(w, h, x, y) generates a spiral matrix of width w and height h, and tells you what the value
is at position x, y in that matrix. Note that 1,1 is in the top left corner of a matrix. 
See [Ulam Spiral rectangular grid construction] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral#Construction) for more 
details. 

This was mostly a mental exercise, and something for [Joseph] (https://github.com/jcla1) to use.
